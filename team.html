          <p>The textile industry, as an important sector of fashion industry, is the second largest pollution source in
            the world. Traditional textile manufacturing processes, which separate fiber production from dyeing, are
            highly water-intensive and incompatible with the principles of sustainable fashion. To address these
            challenges, our project developed an integrated system for bacterial cellulose weaving and dyeing using
            <i>E. coli</i>. We have achieved one-step synthesis of colored bacterial cellulose through temperature
            regulation. At 25 ℃, bacterial cellulose was produced in large quantities through cascade amplification.
            When the temperature was raised to 37 ℃, natural pigments were expressed to realize customizable and
            pollution-free dyeing. We added hydrophobic proteins to the surface of bacterial cellulose to form a
            hydrophobic coating to enhance the fabric’s waterproof performance. This project aims to overcome the
            limitations of low bacterial cellulose yield expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and endow it with hydrophobic
            properties. It provides a solution for the fashion industry that integrates functional aesthetics with
            environmentally friendly choices.

            <h3>Cultural Connection</h3>
            <p>"NAU-CHINA’s project, "Temperature-Controlled One-step Synthesis of Colored Bacterial Cellulose,"
              initially stemmed from concerns about high pollution in the modern textile industry. Yet during its
              research and development process, it struck a cross-temporal chord with China’s millennia-old textile
              civilization. Looking back at the ancient Silk Road, Chinese textile techniques have always embodied the
              wisdom of aligning with nature and the seasons, and creating with low carbon impact. The ancients raised
              silkworms on mulberry leaves, extracted silk to weave brocades, and every step, from mulberry cultivation
              to dyeing and finishing, followed the laws of nature, prioritizing natural materials and low-consumption
              craftsmanship. This commitment to coexisting harmoniously with nature aligns perfectly with our technical
              pursuit.</p>
            <p>The bacterial cellulose we developed is a natural bio-based material that requires no land for
              cultivation. Its biodegradable nature frees traditional textile raw materials from their reliance on the
              environment, while still retaining silk’s desirable qualities: lightness, breathability,
              skin-friendliness, and flexibility. Furthermore, our project represents an innovative upgrade to the
              ancient traditional process of "weaving and dyeing in one pot." In ancient times, fabrics required
              multiple steps: spinning, weaving, and dyeing; by contrast, we regulate the metabolic temperature of
              microorganisms to achieve simultaneous dyeing of bacterial cellulose during its synthesis. This not only
              preserves the ancient aesthetic pursuit of natural colors in traditional dyeing but also reduces pollution
              emissions in production through one-step formation, putting the ancients’ low-carbon creation concept into
              modern practice.</p>
            <p>From the natural wisdom of ancient textiles to modern biosynthesis, what has changed is the technical
              pathway; what remains unchanged is the core of Chinese culture —— respecting nature and refining
              craftsmanship. We hope this technology will serve as a starting point: while offering a solution to
              pollution in the textile industry, it will also allow the environmental and nature-centered philosophy of
              ancient textile civilization to thrive in the era of synthetic biology.</p>

          <p>Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic
            neurons, leading to motor impairments such as tremors and rigidity. Current treatments rely on L-DOPA
            supplementation, but long-term use results in decreased efficacy and severe side effects. To address these
            limitations, we propose engineering Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) to biosynthesize and regulate
            L-DOPA production using the yeast codon-optimized CYP76AD6 gene from Beta vulgaris partnered with the AR2
            gene from Arabidopsis thaliana. By integrating metabolic engineering and synthetic biology, our system aims
            to improve L-DOPA bioavailability while reducing treatment-related complications. The system incorporates
            sophisticated feedback mechanisms to maintain optimal L-DOPA levels, offering a potentially ground-breaking
            approach to PD therapy.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Connection</h3>
            <p>Our project to engineer Saccharomyces cerevisiae for self-regulated L-DOPA biosynthesis is deeply
              connected to traditional culture through both direct inheritance and metaphorical resonance. Yeast itself
              has accompanied human civilization for thousands of years, central to bread, wine, and medicinal
              fermentation in cultures across the world. By using yeast as our living platform, we inherit a method that
              generations before us relied on: harnessing the vitality of microbes to improve human health and
              wellbeing.</p>
            <p>At the same time, our approach draws inspiration from traditional medical practices that emphasized
              balance and regulation. In Chinese medicine, for example, treatments are designed not simply to supply
              what is lacking, but to restore harmony within the body’s systems. Similarly, our self-regulating yeast
              model does not flood the body with L-DOPA in an unstable way, but continuously senses and adjusts
              production to maintain equilibrium. This reflects a cultural philosophy that health arises from dynamic
              balance rather than forceful intervention.</p>
            <p>There is also a symbolic dimension. Just as fermentation transforms simple ingredients into something
              more
              powerful and sustaining, our project reimagines an ancient process with modern tools of synthetic biology.
              In this sense, it becomes a metaphor for cultural continuity: the old methods are not abandoned but
              reinvented, giving them renewed relevance in addressing today’s challenges.
              Through direct inheritance of microbial technology, inspiration from traditional concepts of balance, and
              metaphorical reflection on transformation, our project demonstrates that scientific innovation and
              cultural tradition are not separate paths. Instead, they intersect and enrich one another, showing how
              humanity’s oldest practices can guide cutting-edge solutions for the future.</p>

          <p>Folate(vitamin B9) is an important vitamin in the human body and is involved in the synthesis of many
            important biomolecules within the body. A deficiency of follate in the human body can lead to diseases such
            as megaloblastic anemia, birth defects, and impaired cognitive development. However, folic acid cannot be
            synthesized independently in the human body and must be obtained from the outside. About 50% of the world's
            population is insufficient folate intake. People in underdeveloped areas have a relatively large gap in
            folate due to their dietary structure and economic conditions. And groups such as lactating pregnant women
            need to ensure an adequate intake of folate. The whole world needs higher-quality folate to address issues
            such as hidden hunger and promote a healthy lifestyle. Soybean as the main food crop, the protein in the

            <p>The high-folate soybean enrichment project represents a direct continuation and scientific elevation of
              China's traditional wisdom of "food as medicine." The ancient adage "food supplementation is superior to
              drug supplementation" captures its essence perfectly. Instead of relying on external additives, the
              project employs biotechnology to enhance the nutritional value of a staple crop itself. This enables a
              subtle yet effective public health intervention, aligning seamlessly with the traditional dietary

            <p>In its methodology, the project draws inspiration from the traditional farming principle of "meticulous
              cultivation." It avoids a brute-force approach, focusing instead on improving seed genetics—much like the
              ancient practice of carefully selecting and breeding crops. This demonstrates a respect for and skillful
              utilization of natural principles.</p>
            <p>On a deeper, metaphorical level, the project embodies the safeguarding of "the continuity of life."

          <p>To address gastrointestinal diseases caused by dysbiosis of the gut microbiota during the perioperative
            period (often due to chemical, mechanical, and antibiotic stimuli from surgical preparation), we have
            engineered the probiotic Lactobacillus casei. This strain can colonize the intestinal environment and
            express downstream genes upon induction by bile salts (which are present only in the intestines).</p>
          <p>Firstly, we recombined the OLE1 gene from yeast cells into the engineered probiotic. OLE1 is an unsaturated
            fatty acid synthase that enables the probiotic to convert short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) into oleic acid.
            Studies have shown that oleic acid can enhance the activity of gut probiotics and inhibit the growth of
            pathogenic microorganisms. Additionally, we incorporated the human defensin DEFB4A sequence into another
            plasmid. DEFB4A is an oligomeric protein that can be expressed in prokaryotes and has the function of
            enhancing the intestinal mucosal barrier.</p>
          <p>Our engineered probiotic can be used as a food additive or capsule to improve and reshape the gut
            microbiota, enhancing the intestinal epithelial barrier function to treat gastrointestinal diseases during
            the perioperative period.</p>

            <p>Ancient Chinese medicine recognized the importance of the
              gastrointestinal tract early on. Medicines for treating gastrointestinal diseases were prepared using
              multiple herbs through “processed preparation,” achieving the core goal of “reducing toxicity while
              enhancing efficacy.” Drawing inspiration from this “reducing toxicity while enhancing efficacy” logic in
              traditional Chinese medicine, we employed modern synthetic biology techniques to create an engineered
              bacterium capable of improving the gut microbiome.</p>
            <p>Our team did not select traditional E. coli probiotics as the chassis cell. As a prokaryote, E. coli
              retains certain pathogenicity toward humans. Replacing E. coli with lactic acid bacteria achieves the
              “reducing toxicity” effect. We recombined the OLE1 gene with human defensin DEFB4A into the engineered
              bacterium, aiming to enhance gastrointestinal activity using oleic acid converted by OLE1 and strengthen
              the intestinal mucosal barrier function with DEFB4A. The combination of these two genes with the chassis
              cell exhibits synergistic promotion, achieving the goal of “enhancement.”</p>
            <p>Using the Chinese medicine logic of "reducing toxicity and increasing efficacy" and modern synthetic
              biology, our team has designed a brand new engineered bacterium that can be used as a food additive or
              capsule, which is excellent for improving and treating gastrointestinal disorders caused by intestinal
              flora imbalance in the perioperative period. Only through the organic integration of traditional culture
              and biological science can the path of synthetic biology truly shine.</p>

            drew inspiration from the freeze-resistance wisdom of polar organisms. Combining synthetic biology and

            <h3>Cultural Connection</h3>
            <p>Inspired by Kunpeng, a mythical creature from Zhuangzi·Xiao Yao You, this project integrates the cultural
              essence of Kunpeng into modern synthetic biology—focusing on its trait of "surviving in extreme cold
              without fear," which aligns perfectly with the project’s core anti-freeze theme.</p>
            <p>Direct inheritance: The project echoes Kunpeng’s spirit of breaking constraints and reflects its cold
              resistance. Abandoning flaws of traditional anti-freeze methods (impractical physical ice-breaking,
              polluting and short-lived chemical reagents), it uses genetic engineering to modify microbes for
              biosynthesizing antifreeze proteins (AFPs), offering eco-friendly, long-lasting solutions to cold-related
              fashion issues—just as Kunpeng resists cold with its own abilities, not temporary external means.</p>
            <p>Method inspiration: Technical ideas come from Kunpeng’s transformation. Introducing trehalose metabolic
              pathways into microbial strains which mirrors Kun "storing strength in cold water” lays the foundation;
              then displaying 11 AFPs on EBY100 yeast surface via disulfide bonds, forming functional "Peng" form;
              optimizing AFPs through point mutation, domain rearrangement and Cre recombination is like Peng
              "sharpening wings to enhance cold resistance," replicating the logic of "adapting to cold via
              self-evolution."</p>
            <p>Metaphor explanation: The project’s vision connects to Kunpeng’s image of "lofty aspirations and cold
              fearlessness." Its eco-friendly solution fits Zhuangzi’s concept of "harmonious coexistence with nature,"
              turning Kunpeng—a cultural symbol of cold-resistant resilience—into a driver for sustainable anti-freeze
              innovation.</p>

          <p>As a common chronic disease in the world, hemorrhoids has a high prevalence in our country, and pregnant
            women are particularly susceptible. Existing therapies include anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics, and
            minimally invasive surgery, which have certain efficacy, but may have problems such as full side effects,
            overtreatment, contraindications and low compliance in pregnant women, and it is difficult to accurately
            regulate angiogenesis and inflammatory response. In order to overcome the existing limitations, we have
            designed innovative therapies based on the engineered bacterial OMV delivery system. Engineered bacteria can
            degrade HIF-1α protein, anti-VEGF antibodies and engineered melitian peptides through OMV targeted delivery,
            which can synergistically inhibit hemorrhoidal venous plexus dilation and alleviate local inflammation. At
            the same time, the project introduces a black rice ribose switch control loop to realize the cooperation
            between medicine and food, so that the engineered bacteria can be specifically activated after ingestion of
            black rice, taking into account both treatment and healthy diet intervention. In addition, we have developed

            <h3>Cultural Connection</h3>
            <p>Our project—HemorrEaser—is built on the idea of starting from diet, using food-derived metabolites to
              activate engineered bacteria for the treatment of hemorrhoids. In Chinese traditional culture, diet is not
              only a means of sustaining life but is also endowed with the function of nurturing health and preventing
              disease. Ancient scholars emphasized the principle of “Food & Medicine Homology” (yao shi tong yuan),
              highlighting the role of grains and herbs in maintaining balance within the body. Inspired by this
              philosophy, we examined its relevance to modern medicine. However, our research revealed that dietary
              therapy alone is insufficient to meet contemporary therapeutic demands. Therefore, our team proposes a new
              concept—"medicine–food collaboration”—in which food and medicine work hand in hand: diet provides the
              activating signals, while engineered bacteria serve as the therapeutic agents, creating a synergistic
              effect.</p>
            <p>This approach preserves the traditional wisdom of “using food as nourishment”, while simultaneously
              introducing the modern tools of synthetic biology, thereby building new bridges between diet and health.
              At a deeper level, it also reflects cultural values of collaboration and harmony, symbolizing the

          <p>We have designed a genetically edited Lactobacillus strain for the prevention and treatment of dental
            caries, and restore the balance of the oral microbiota. These engineered Lactobacillus bacteria are capable
            of detecting quorum sensing signals from cariogenic bacteria within the oral microbiome. They integrate into
            the biofilms formed by harmful bacteria and secrete antimicrobial substances, disrupting the structure and
            function of these biofilms. This approach facilitates the biological control of dental caries and other oral
            diseases. We will employ the quorum sensing system sequences from Streptococcus mutans (S.m.) and, after
            codon optimization, introduce them into Lactobacillus to enable responsiveness to S.m.'s quorum sensing
            signals. Specifically, we obtained the complete genome sequencing information of S.m. from the NCBI database
            and identified the coding segments corresponding to the quorum sensing system in a research paper. These
            include the sequences ComD, ComE, and the promoter ComX. ComD and ComE form a two-component system that
            detects the extracellular Csp signaling molecules (originating from S.m.). Subsequently, the promoter ComX
            initiates the transcription of downstream genes, including the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fragment and
            an antimicrobial peptide fragment.</p>
          <p>To evaluate the functionality of the engineered Lactobacillus, we will co-culture it with S.m. to assess
            its
            antimicrobial efficacy and ability to inhibit detrimental biofilm formation. By observing whether the
            Lactobacillus can effectively respond to the quorum sensing signals of S.m. and reduce biofilm formation, we
            can validate the effectiveness of its modification.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Connection</h3>
            <p>This project, while firmly grounded in modern synthetic biology, shares a profound conceptual kinship
              with traditional cultural wisdom. Its core principle—using a beneficial organism to naturally counteract a
              harmful one—directly echoes ancient philosophies of balance, such as the Chinese concept of Yin and Yang,
              which emphasizes how opposing forces are interconnected and can be harnessed to achieve harmony within a
              system. In this case, the oral microbiome.</p>
            <p>The methodology is inspired by traditional strategic thought. Instead of employing a blunt, aggressive
              attack on harmful bacteria (akin to using overwhelming force), our engineered Lactobacillus operates with
              the subtlety and precision of a strategic intervention. It integrates into the enemy's ranks (the
              biofilm), understands its communication (quorum sensing), and then disrupts it from within. This mirrors
              ancient military strategies that valued intelligence, infiltration, and disrupting an opponent's cohesion
              over direct confrontation.</p>
            <p>Metaphorically, the project can be seen as a form of biological "guardianship." The engineered bacteria
              act as benevolent sentinels placed within the oral ecology. They constantly monitor the environment, and
              only when they detect the specific signals of disease (the "rebellion" of pathogenic bacteria) do they
              activate their defense mechanisms to restore order and health. This reflects a deep-seated cultural
              preference for proactive, intelligent guardianship that maintains harmony and prevents crisis, rather than
              merely reacting to it.</p>
            <p>In summary, we use synthetic biology to create a beneficial bacterial guardian that restores natural
              balance in the oral microbiome, an approach inspired by ancient philosophies of harmony and strategic
              intervention.</p>

            <p>Our iGEM project is dedicated to the detection and degradation of microplastics, drawing profound
              inspiration from the ancient Silk Road—a historically rich network of trade and cultural exchange. Just as
              the Silk Road connected civilizations through shared knowledge and resources, synthetic biology enables us
              to bridge traditional wisdom with modern innovation. For instance, ancient Chinese techniques for breaking
              down natural materials—such as the use of microbial fermentation in traditional practices—conceptually
              align with our engineered bacteria designed to decompose microplastics.</p>
            <p>To draw an analogy, our bioremediation system echoes the spirit of cross-border collaboration and
              problem-solving that defined the Silk Road. By integrating biosensors inspired by natural biological “Silk
              Roads,” such as cellular signaling pathways, we address global pollution challenges while honoring this
              legacy. The project embodies a dialogue between the past and the present: leveraging ancient ecological
              insights to pioneer sustainable solutions for the future.</p>
            <p>Expanding on this vision, we are developing a multi-layered biological system that not only detects
              microplastic contamination with high specificity through sensitive protein-based receptors, but also
              utilizes enhanced enzymatic pathways to break down plastics into harmless byproducts. This approach is
              inspired by historical methods where natural microorganisms were employed in processes like composting and
              textile degradation—practices with roots in ancient East Asian cultures. Furthermore, the modular design
              of our system allows for adaptability and scalability, reflecting the Silk Road’s role in facilitating
              adaptable and resilient exchanges across diverse regions.</p>
            <p>By framing our solution within a historical and cultural context, we aim to highlight how biological
              innovation can be deeply rooted in human heritage while addressing contemporary environmental crises.
              Ultimately, this project is not only a technical effort but also a tribute to the timeless spirit of
              cooperation and ingenuity that the Silk Road represents.</p>

          <p>Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic brain diseases worldwide, which can triple the risk of premature
            death for patients. Ketogenic diet therapy is a relatively long-term and effective treatment. The process of
            liver ketogenesis may lead to side effects such as ketoacidosis.
            To this end, we designed a pathway capable of producing ketone body β - hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) in
            Escherichia coli Nissle1917 and designed a dynamic regulatory module. We use double-layer hydrogel to wrap
            the engineered bacteria and colonize them in the intestinal tract, while ensuring safety. We have developed

            <p>Our epilepsy prevention and treatment program, while pursuing the frontier of science and technology, is
              also deeply rooted in the excellent traditional Chinese culture and has a deep and organic connection with
              it.</p>
            <p>In terms of therapy concept, the concept of "food and medicine homology" in traditional Chinese medicine
              emphasizes diet to regulate the internal organs, and the inspiration of the project is the ketogenic diet
              to control metabolism and inhibit neuronal abnormalities with high fat and low carbon, which is the
              exposition of this idea. The intestinal colonization engineering bacteria technology developed by the team
              bypasses liver ketogenesis and reduces side effects, which is in line with the ancient thinking of
              "reducing toxicity and increasing efficiency", and effectively realizes the combination of traditional and
              modern technology.</p>
            <p>In the monitoring system, we are inspired by traditional Chinese medicine to "treat diseases before they
              occur" and "see the details", not limited to the moment of attack, but through intelligent wearable
              devices and algorithms, to achieve long-term and holistic analysis of EEG signals, and transform the
              ancient early warning philosophy into calculable data and audible alarms.</p>
            <p>Epilepsy is often misunderstood as "evil spirit" in ancient times. Historically, from Emperor Wu of the
              Han Dynasty to Bai Juyi, many great men have been shrouded in the haze of epilepsy. Today we stand on the
              shoulders of modern medicine, and we should neither deify the disease nor stigmatize the patient. May
              everyone correctly understand epilepsy diseases, care for epilepsy patients, every state of life is worthy
              of respect, and the significance of science and technology lies in gently guarding every uniqueness.</p>

          <p>Lychees are a beloved fruit in Cantonese culture, but they spoil very quickly after harvest because of
            their thin skin and fast metabolism. This makes it difficult to transport them over long distances while
            keeping their freshness. Our project, Lychee Guardians, aims to solve this problem by combining natural
            protection with synthetic biology.
            First, we use engineered bacteria to produce melatonin, a plant hormone that slows down aging, reduces
            damage from oxidation, and boosts the fruit’s natural defenses. By applying melatonin, we help lychees stay
            fresh for longer.
            Second, we designed a system for bacteria to create a protective wax coating on the fruit’s surface. This
            wax acts like a natural shield, reducing water loss and preventing cracks in the skin that lead to faster
            spoilage.
            To monitor freshness, we also built a pH sensor module that glows when the lychee starts to become less
            fresh, offering a simple way to track quality. On the computational side, we used AI tools to analyze
            genetic data and create a lychee dataset that helps improve our preservation system.
            Through these approaches, we hope to extend the shelf life of lychees and make this treasured fruit more
            widely available around the world.</p>

            <p>The lychee has long been more than just a fruit—it is a symbol deeply rooted in Lingnan culture and
              history. In ancient times, fresh lychees were carried over 2,500 kilometers from Guangdong to Chang’an,
              the imperial capital, to delight the royal court. This journey was so famous that the Tang poet Du Mu
              wrote, “A steed raising red dust wins the concubine’s smile; no one knows it was for a lychee.” Yet behind
              the romance was a race against time: lychees, known for changing color in one day, losing aroma in two,
              and flavor in three, often spoiled before reaching their destination. Ancient people devised clever
              methods—sealing fruits in bamboo tubes, cooling them with ice jars, or coating them with beeswax — but
              these were limited by climate, distance, and technology.</p>
            <p>Our iGEM project, Lychee Guardians, draws inspiration from this history. Just as our ancestors sought
              ways
              to preserve the fleeting freshness of the lychee, we apply modern synthetic biology to achieve the same
              goal in more scientific and sustainable ways. By engineering bacteria to produce melatonin, we slow down
              aging and oxidation in the fruit. By designing microbes that generate a protective wax layer, we create a
              biological shield against water loss and pathogens. In addition, our pH sensor provides a visual signal of
              freshness, echoing the ancient wisdom of observing subtle changes in the fruit.</p>
            <p>In this way, our project forms a dialogue between past and present: ancient couriers once relied on human
              endurance and natural tricks, while we rely on biological engineering and AI tools. Both share the same
              cultural desire — to preserve what is precious. Through Lychee Guardians, we hope to honor traditional
              ingenuity while offering a forward-looking solution that allows the beloved lychee to travel farther and
              last longer in today’s world.</p>

            challenges, our BUCT-China presents BrightWate, a synthetic biology-based solution that upcycles both types
            of waste into a value-added luminescent material.</p>
          <p>The project involves two key enzymatic conversions: PETase degrades polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into

              Zhuangzi·Knowledge Wanders North, "all things are in a constant state of transformation," revealing the
              natural principle of material conversion and cycles. The Ming Dynasty text Tiangong Kaiwu documented
              techniques for repurposing waste materials—such as crafting bricks from rice husks and paper from
              straw—showcasing the ancient practice of "making the best use of everything." Today, BUCT-China’s
              BrightWaste project stands as a modern scientific and engineering response to this Eastern philosophy.</p>
            <p>Using synthetic biology as its brush, the project paints a new chapter of "transforming decay into
              magic":
              PETase enzymes break down plastic into terephthalic acid (TPA), while cGTase enzymes convert starch from
              food waste into β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). These two components self-assemble into PPA-CD supramolecular

              anti-counterfeiting labels and fluorescent tags.</p>
            <p>Where artisans of the past used ingenuity to repurpose waste, scientists today employ enzymatic catalysis

              resilience, the SILK project threads Xinjiang’s extremophilic plasmids into the fabric of industrial
              biotechnology—hoping to create a "modern genetic Silk Road" that bridges natural adaptation and human
              innovation. Xinjiang, a historic hub of the Silk Road, has long been a crossroads where environmental
              harshness spurred biological and cultural resilience; its microbes, like the traders of old, have evolved
              "survival strategies" (encoded in plasmids) to thrive amid aridity and extremes.</p>
              <p>This project directly draws inspiration from the Silk Road’s core principles: connection, adaptation, and
              sustainability. Where merchants once transported silk—a material valued for its strength and
              versatility—we transport plasmids: molecular "silk threads" of DNA that encode multi-gene stress
              resistance, offering industrial strains the same adaptability that allowed Silk Road communities to
              flourish in diverse climates.</p>
              <p>Metaphorically, the plasmid’s circular structure mirrors the Silk Road’s cyclical exchange of ideas, while
              its modular genetic elements reflect the road’s modular trade networks—each gene, like a traded commodity,
              contributing unique value to the whole. By preserving and repurposing Xinjiang’s microbial heritage, we
              honor the region’s legacy as a cradle of resilience, proving that just as silk transformed global
              commerce, these "genetic silks" can transform industrial sustainability. In doing so,may the SILK
              redefines "biological trade" for the 21st century: exchanging not goods, but the evolutionary wisdom of
              extremophiles to build a more robust, interconnected world.</p>

        <div class="project-description">
          <p>The aerospace industry has been thriving in recent years. However, as pioneering astronauts step by step
            fulfill our wonderful dream of flying to the sky, do we understand their situation? Limited and monotonous
            food choices, unfulfilled social and psychological needs... Perhaps, we can fill this void with the unique
            cuisine of our hometown! We plan to bring crayfish into space, achieve space farming of crayfish through
            co-culture with aquatic plants, and utilize synthetic biology technology to design a resource recovery and
            recycling system for crayfish shells: first, through Aspergillus niger and modified Escherichia coli that
            can secrete protease, demineralization and deproteinization are achieved; after purifying chitin, it is
            mixed with Martian regolith to achieve in-situ production of engineering materials; finally, chitin is
            degraded from discarded materials into monosaccharides that can be utilized by animals and plants, feeding
            back into the plant and animal production system.</p>
            <p>Our ultimate goal is not just to bring a few engineered bacteria and a set of operational equipment to Mars,
            nor just to bring spicy crayfish to astronauts' dining tables, but to bring people's most fundamental and
            simple emotions, along with the expanded footprints of human being, to the farthest depths of the universe.

            <h3>Cultural Connection</h3>
            <p>If the Silk Road is a segment connecting Eastern and Western civilizations, then we believe that the
              future of humanity and synthetic biology will be a ray that starts from Earth and continues to extend into
              the universe. On this ray, the light of technology illuminates the path ahead, while the warmth of
              humanity imbues exploration with meaning.</p>
              <p>With the rapid development of technology, traditional culture and humanistic sentiments are often impacted
              or even marginalized. However, in the 'DEIMOS' project, we attempted to build a bridge that would prevent
              technology from becoming cold and culture from becoming silent. We use ‘spicy crayfish’, a food with a
              strong collective memory of China, as a carrier to bring the hustle and bustle on Earth to the lonely
              space. Our building materials will continue to pave the way for technology and culture to advance hand in
              hand. Our crayfish will remind future aerospace workers that what we bring from Earth to space should not
              only be human technology and ambition, but also cultural memories, humanistic care, and the emotions and
              connections that make us human.</p>
              <p>We would like to remind those who are at the forefront of technology through this project: while looking
              up at the stars, perhaps only by looking back at the past can we walk more steadily and further. The roots
              of culture have never broken, it only accompanies humanity in new forms towards a deeper universe.</p>
