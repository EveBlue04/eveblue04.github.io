        Welcome to the official website of Into China, Into iGEM (ICII). Here, you are about to witness a dialogue spanning millennia —— where ancient traditional Chinese culture and cutting-edge synthetic biology technology break the boundaries of time and space, linked by the "Modern Silk Road of Synthetic Biology". In their interaction, new sparks are kindled, ones that embody both the warmth of culture and the power of science and technology.
      </p>
      <p class="text-content" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
        Our inspiration for this theme stems from NAU-CHINA’s project "Temperature Controlled One-step Synthesis of Colored Bacterial Cellulose", a work which is closely tied to fabric creation, and reminded us of the ancient Silk Road. Just as silk once carried Chinese culture across continents, we believe ICII can become a "Modern Silk Road" for synthetic biology, spreading China’s cultural heritage to the world.
      </p>

        For "ICII", it is not merely an invitation to "step into China and step into iGEM," but more importantly, a bridge of emotional connection. We hope everyone who comes here can gradually draw closer to China’s traditional wisdom and grow to love the innovative atmosphere of the iGEM community amid the integration of scientific research and culture. Through "ICII Panorama," you can explore the research projects of different teams rooted in China by following the map, and experience the unique integration of regional culture and scientific innovation.

      <p class="text-content" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1000">
        In the "Dialogue Gallery," you can see how cultural treasure such as traditional craftsmanship and traditional medicine collide with synthetic biology to generate innovative solutions to real-world problems.
        You can also join global enthusiasts in the "Silk Road Forum" section to share stories of cultural inheritance and discuss the direction of technological development.
        ICII is ready to unfold the "Modern Silk Road" journey and we want you right here with us. As time-honored traditions meet cutting-edge science, let’s walk together to uncover traditional Chinese culture’s contemporary value and feel the diverse charm of the iGEM community.
