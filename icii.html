        When the "Modern Silk Road of Synthetic Biology" was translated from NAU-CHINA’s vision into reality, the first to gather were a group of like-minded peers who shared the original aspiration of integrating culture and technology. Responding to our sincere invitation, 14 teams transcended geographical boundaries, took scientific research as the threads and cities as the dots, and jointly outlined this ICII "Modern Silk Road Panorama" across eight cities: Hainan, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Tianjin, Beijing and Lanzhou.<br><br>
        Every city marker on the map is a vital stop along this modern Silk Road. Each team has come with a passion for exploring synthetic biology and a deep regard for traditional culture —— some may draw inspiration from the cultural heritage of their cities, while others may use technology to find a modern expression for traditional wisdom. Although their specific research directions are still being refined, their shared original aspiration of promoting culture through technology has linked these stops closely together. This is just like the ancient Silk Road, where civilizations from different regions thrived together because of their shared vision for exchange.<br><br>
        The team stories and scientific research explorations hidden behind these markers will be presented to you through the map’s interactive features:
