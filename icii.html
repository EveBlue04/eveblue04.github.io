      <div class="content-text">
        <p>When the "Modern Silk Road of Synthetic Biology" was translated from NAU-CHINA's vision into reality,
          the first to gather were a group of like-minded peers who shared the original aspiration of
          integrating culture and technology. Responding to our sincere invitation, 14 teams transcended
          geographical boundaries, took scientific research as the threads and cities as the dots, and jointly
          outlined this ICII "Modern Silk Road Panorama" across eight cities: Hainan, Guangzhou, Hangzhou,
          Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Tianjin, Beijing and Lanzhou.</p>

        <p>Every city marker on the map is a vital stop along this modern Silk Road. Each team has come with a
          passion for exploring synthetic biology and a deep regard for traditional culture —— some may draw
          inspiration from the cultural heritage of their cities, while others may use technology to find a
          modern expression for traditional wisdom. Although their specific research directions are still
          being refined, their shared original aspiration of promoting culture through technology has linked
          these stops closely together. This is just like the ancient Silk Road, where civilizations from
          different regions thrived together because of their shared vision for exchange.</p>

        <p>The team stories and scientific research explorations hidden behind these markers will be presented
          to you through the map's interactive features: hover your mouse over a marker to view the team name,
          and click on the icon to jump to an exclusive page, where you can gain an in-depth understanding of
          the team's style and their "dialogue spanning millennia".</p>

        <p>From the germination of one team's original aspiration to the joint journey of 12 teams, from the
          geographical connection of six cities to the spiritual resonance between technology and culture,
          this panorama is far more than a display of team information. It is a continuation of the Silk Road
          spirit —— defined by openness, inclusiveness, exchange, and mutual learning —— in the field of
          contemporary scientific research. Every marker is a starting point for cultural transmission, and
          every team is a fellow traveler on the modern Silk Road. Together, they show the world the
          determination and strength of China's young researchers to "tell cultural stories well through
          science and technology".</p>
